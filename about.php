            <br>
			We have been manufacturing windows and patio doors since the year 2000, as a family owned business.  In 2005, we incorporated our business.  The business began in the city of Los Angeles, but our commitment to provide our customers with high quality products at reasonable pricing, has catapulted our growth and enabled us to relocate to a newer and larger facility. We are conveniently located by the 710/91 freeway interchange in Paramount, California.  We have easy access for loading & unloading, and our warehouse staff is ready to fulfill your orders with the fastest turnaround time in the business. The layout of our showroom allows you to browse our extensive types of vinyl windows and doors. Our sales team is always available and ready to help you calculate and design your visions. Premium Windows will continue to add other products that we feel will be of great benefit to you.</p>
